Download 'Steamworks SDK v1.57' or later from 'https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list' and put the /public and /redistributable_bin inside the SDK/Steamworks folder.
Download 'EOS SDK v1.16.1' (later versions might not work correctly) from 'https://dev.epicgames.com/portal' and put /Bin /Include and /Lib inside the SDK/EOS folder.

Change the App ID in steam_appid.txt to your app ID, can be found here: 'https://partner.steamgames.com/apps'.
Copy and paste the 'steam_appid.txt' and 'steam_api.dll' (found in 'SDK\Steamworks\redistributable_bin') to your unreal engine installation folder (probably 'Program Files\Epic Games\engine_version\Binaries\Win64').
