Files need to be in '/Binaries/Win64' in both the project folder and the Unreal-Engine install folder.
Steamworks SDK will be enabled in the editor if the dll is present. (and steam_appid.txt for non-shipping).


So:

ProjectFolder/Binaries/Win64

Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2\Engine\Binaries\Win64
