"This is a sample configuration file for using the Steam online subsystem with UE4. It includes the following sections:

GameEngine: This section defines the NetDriverDefinitions for the game. It specifies that the GameNetDriver uses the SteamNetDriver from the OnlineSubsystemSteam plugin. If that is not available, it will fallback to using the IPNetDriver from the OnlineSubsystemUtils plugin.

OnlineSubsystem: This section sets the default online subsystem to use as Steam.

OnlineSubsystemSteam: This section enables the Steam online subsystem and sets the SteamDevAppId to 480, which is the App ID for the Spacewar sample game. It also sets the bInitServerOnClient flag to true, which allows a client to become a server if needed.

OnlineSubsystemSteam.SteamNetDriver: This section specifies the NetConnectionClassName to use for the SteamNetDriver.

OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver: This section sets the maximum tick rate for the IPNetDriver to 60."
