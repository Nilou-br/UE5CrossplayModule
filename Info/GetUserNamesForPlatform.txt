To get the names of every user in the lobby, you need to combine EOS SDK with the respective platform's SDK (such as Steamworks for Steam).

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you might need to take:

When a user joins the lobby, fetch the list of current lobby members using EOS SDK (for example, with the EOS_Lobby_GetMemberCount and EOS_Lobby_GetMemberAtIndex functions).

For each member, get their EOS ProductUserId (which uniquely identifies a user across all linked accounts).

Use EOS_Connect_QueryProductUserIdMappings to convert the ProductUserId to the platform-specific ID (like Steam ID). This function works asynchronously, so you will have to wait for the callback to get the result.

Once you have the platform-specific ID, use the platform's own SDK to get the username. For Steam, this can be done with ISteamFriends::GetFriendPersonaName.

This process needs to be done for each platform you want to support, and may vary slightly depending on the platform's SDK. Always make sure to check the documentation for the most up-to-date and accurate information.

Remember that this process involves asynchronous operations and can take some time, so you'll want to handle these operations carefully to ensure your application remains responsive. Also, consider privacy issues and make sure you are allowed to share this information according to the platform's terms of service.
